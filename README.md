This web application simplifies meal management for schools under the PM Poshan Abhiyaan initiative by enabling seamless communication between schools, government authorities, and suppliers.
Schools can place and track meal orders, authorities can monitor requests in real time, and suppliers can manage deliveries efficiently.
The system uses Java Servlets for backend processing, JSP for dynamic interfaces, and MySQL (via JDBC) for secure data storage. Developed and tested on XAMPP, it ensures scalability and reliability.
